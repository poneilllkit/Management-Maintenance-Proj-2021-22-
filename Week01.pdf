Management + Maintenance Proj (2021/22) â€“ Week 01

The Company
South Web Design is a complete service design and development agency. Since 2013 they have consistently focused on innovating in ways that others cannot and being ahead of the curve. Nowadays, we have mobile, tablet, and pc displays, so making sure a responsive plan is considered at the outset of any design conversion is key to success. When targeting these various display types we have to consider not only the size restrictions but also how the devices are viewing the applications. This means we have to ensure the applications built are not only responsive to mobile devices but are also responsive to the numerous browsers found in these devices. 

As the demand for responsive, dynamic and secure websites and web applications increases everyday, so does the demand on infrastructure and resources. The company has expanded rapidly increasing its workforce from 5 to 12 people working on site and 4 developers working remotely. Expansion of the currently overloaded network infrastructure is a priority for the business moving forward with an improved setup and are looking for assistance in setting it up efficiently and securely.
